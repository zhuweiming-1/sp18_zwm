Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the project 2 side?
你能想到镶嵌六边形的过程和使用房间和走廊随机生成世界之间的类比吗？什么是六边形，项目 2 边的镶嵌是什么？

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.
如果你开始研究世界生成，你会首先想到什么样的写作方法？回想一下实验和最终用于镶嵌六边形的过程。

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?
对于镶嵌六边形，最困难的部分之一是弄清楚每个六边形的放置位置如何以算法方式轻松地将六边形放置在屏幕上。
查看自己的实现后，请考虑在实验室接近尾声时提供的实现。您的实现与给定的实现有何不同？可以从中吸取什么教训？

Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.
考虑一种在地图上放置房间和走廊的算法。理想情况下，考虑许多算法并考虑是什么使某些算法更容易或更难实现。
尝试将这些想法整合到一个简单的算法中，以完成任务。一般来说，边缘情况尽可能少的算法是更好的算法。
